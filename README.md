# Register-MiniGame

I built this for my freeCodeCamp certification. 

I liked my style of build better and had the time to add extra features so i sumbitted a base game to freeCodeCamp and this is the one with extras. 
The basic one that they had me build passed a single price and you could only change the cash given to pay the bill. 

I built mine so that it would have a random number generator on the price to give it more of an interactive feel. (didn't make it responive for moblie use)
